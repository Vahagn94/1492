# Memeder

Memeder is an android application designed and created for the purpose of having an impact in the lives of people and specially the ones with vision disabilites. Memes can be uploaded to a backend database and be accessed through the android application. Memeder uses text recognizer and text to speech technologies to create an environment usable for hard to see people. User has the ability to swipe through memes and ask for description and text of each meme, if the user likes a meme, they can choose to save it on their device for later use.
